üåø **PLANT TYPE DETECTION**

This project uses a machine learning-based classification model to detect and identify plant types from leaf images. Trained on a curated dataset of known plant species, the model captures unique visual patterns to deliver accurate predictions for new inputs within trained categories.

**Key Highlights:** <br>
**Image-Based Prediction:** Simply upload a leaf image to instantly predict the plant type.<br>
**Smart & Accurate:** Powered by supervised learning for reliable classification performance.<br>
**Trained Intelligence:** Learns from curated leaf datasets for consistent and precise results.<br>
**Fast & User-Friendly:** Designed for quick predictions with an intuitive flow.<br>
 
**Ideal For:** <br>
**Farmers & Agriculturists:** Quickly identify crops and manage plant health more effectively.<br>
**Botanists & Researchers:** Streamline species classification during field studies or lab research.<br>
**Students & Educators:** Learn and teach plant taxonomy with the help of real-time, interactive examples.<br>
**Tech for Green:** Supports the development of digital agriculture and eco-focused innovations.<br><be>
