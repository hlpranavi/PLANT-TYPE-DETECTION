ðŸŒ¿ **PLANT TYPE DETECTION**

This project uses a machine learning-based classification model to detect and identify plant types from leaf images. Trained on a curated dataset of known plant species, the model captures unique visual patterns to deliver accurate predictions for new inputs within trained categories.

**Key Highlights:**
Image-Based Prediction: Simply upload a leaf image to instantly predict the plant type.<br>
Smart & Accurate: Powered by supervised learning for reliable classification performance.<br>
Trained Intelligence: Learns from curated leaf datasets for consistent and precise results.<br>
Fast & User-Friendly: Designed for quick predictions with an intuitive flow.<br>
 
**Ideal For:**
Farmers & Agriculturists: Quickly identify crops and manage plant health more effectively.<br>
Botanists & Researchers: Streamline species classification during field studies or lab research.<br>
Students & Educators: Learn and teach plant taxonomy with the help of real-time, interactive examples.<br>
Tech for Green: Supports the development of digital agriculture and eco-focused innovations.<br><br>

This project highlights the power of machine learning and computer vision in transforming plant identification, paving the way for smarter, tech-driven solutions in agriculture and environmental sustainability.
